<p1 class = "b" style="text-align:left;">My name is Sami. I like to play video games and enjoy engineering. 
I like to create hypothetical designs for possible devices that can be used in real-world applications, for example 
calculator. When I was in grade 11, I made a physics calculator to help me with the major 5 
equations, and so I could calculate the questions with much more precision to find the answer(s)
With low or minimal error of calculations, as they say, its not the tool its how you use it that matters im aware thats
more computer science than engineering but so far coding is the only way I have been able to bring stuff to life as 
engineering requires materials and materials cost money and I aint got no job 😂.

<p>Oh, and 1 more thing before you move on, I LOVE BOBA, especially not to be SO specific, 
    is from Chatime: mango green tea with brown sugar pearls, 100% sugar, and large size. Keep in mind, 
    this is just a personal thing, but like if you do keep this in mind, I won't mind, thanks have a great day 👍 </p>
